'''You are given an integer array nums and two integers l and r. Your task is to find the minimum sum of a subarray whose size is between l and r (inclusive) and whose sum is greater than 0.

Return the minimum sum of such a subarray. If no such subarray exists, return -1.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3, -2, 1, 4], l = 2, r = 3

Output: 1

Explanation:

The subarrays of length between l = 2 and r = 3 where the sum is greater than 0 are:

[3, -2] with a sum of 1
[1, 4] with a sum of 5
[3, -2, 1] with a sum of 2
[-2, 1, 4] with a sum of 3
Out of these, the subarray [3, -2] has a sum of 1, which is the smallest positive sum. Hence, the answer is 1.

class Solution:
    def minimumSumSubarray(self, nums: List[int], l: int, r: int) -> int:
        m=float('inf')
        n=len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i,n):
                t=nums[i:j+1]
                if l<=(len(t))<=r:
                    if sum(t)>0:
                        m=min(m,sum(t))
        return m if m!=float('inf') else -1
